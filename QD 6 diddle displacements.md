# 6 diddle displacements

[YT](gIKOwLqGgHM)

## Why?
1. Freer application of diddles
2. Better organized stickings
3. Speed/fluidity (bring accents out)
4. Playing inner partials

## Exercises
### Snare only

#### Paradiddle displacement 

Paradiddles restart one 16th later every bar.
For this you add a note and repeat the previous
paradiddle.

```
Repeat each bar twice:
X-++ O+-- | +O+- -X-+
+-X- ++O+ | --+O +--X
then same but inverted
```

#### Paradiddle-diddle displacement

```
X-++-- X-++-- | +O+--+ +O+--+
+-X-++ --X-++ | --+O+- -++O+-
-++-X- ++--X- | ++--+O +--++O
then same but inverted (dble O!)
```

#### Double paradiddle displacement

Same idea than the first but with
`X-X-++ O+O++--`

### With bass drums

Use the bass drums to play the added note.

On the last one QD plays HH closed/open!

## Follow up

* Play the accents on the toms but stay
  on the snare.
* Play anywhere on the kit.
* Combine the diddles.
